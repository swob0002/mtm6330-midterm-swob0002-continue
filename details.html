            Lake</a> on this special day. We'll be hosting a casual wedding focused on celebrating
          this milestone with those closest to us. High-level details:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dress code is casual. There's a lake and you're welcome to go swimming, boating, whatever you'd like. Be
            comfortable and enjoy yourself.</li>
          <li>The ceremony part will be non-religious and brief. We want to have a good time instead of trying to
            impress a
            higher power.</li>
          <li>A variety of accommodations (details below) are available nearby, and it's about a 1.5 hour drive to
            downtown
            Ottawa.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Questions or comments for both us can be sent to marieandmark@swoboda.ca. You can also use whatever your
          preferred contact channel is to reach either of us independently.
        </p>
        <p><b>Agenda</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>2 to 4 PM: Arrive and mingle, swim, run naked through the woods and embrace your inner sasquatch, what
            have you.</li>
          <li>4 to 4:30 PM: Wedding ceremony with some words from friends.</li>
          <li>4:30 to 5 PM: More free time while dinner is setup.</li>
          <li>5 to 6:30 PM: Dinner. Accommodations will be available for vegetarians, vegans, gluten-free. Let us know
            your dietary restrictions.</li>
          <li>6:30 PM onward: Adult beverages, dancing, swimming, feats of strength, and other forms of merriment.
            Arrive between 2 to 4 PM, head out after dinner when it suits you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Children</b></p>
        We love your children but are aiming for more of a grown-up party. Consider this an invitation to take a night
        off and have grown-up fun with us. Let us know if this will be a challenge for you.

        <p><b>Accommodations</b></p>
        There are a number of options for guests to stay nearby. We've reserved some rooms for guests which should be
        booked ASAP to ensure you have a place to stay:

        Mohawk Lodge (up to 50 people on Saturday onward): This family resort area is a 10 minute walk away and has 11
        cottages and 2 apartments. It has very affordable weekend rates, and that's a great way to spend your weekend
        without having to travel in and out on the day. Great if you're attending with friends or a family.
        Sharbot Lake Country Inn (5 rooms reserved): This local inn is a 6 minute drive away and has 7 charming rooms.
        It's located in Sharbot Lake itself and on top of a quaint pub.
        Sharbot Lake Provincial Park: For the outdoorsy types, there's a great provincial park not far on the lake. If
        you like camping, then this is a great and extremely low-cost option.
        Looking for something else? Contact us and we'll point you to something that meets your needs.
        <p>Want to drink and not worry about driving? Check the rideshare sign-up. Staying at the inn or the park? Let
          us know and we can see about getting you driven or water-taxied.
        </p>
        <p><b>Getting to Sharbot Lake</b></p>
        You will need to drive, but it's a nice drive up and a beautiful location.

        Directions from Ottawa
        Directions from Toronto: via 401 or via highway 7
        Rideshare sign-up: If you have room in your car, we assure you that none of our guests are maniacs. If you need
        a ride, please don't act like a maniac with your driver. Instead, spend the ride up reminiscing about all the
        things you love most about Jess and Alex.
        Can't figure out how you'll get there? Let us know and we'll see how we can help.
        <p><b>Gifts</b></p>
        You're so thoughtful! Jess and Alex have lots of stuff already, as they've been living in sin for sometime.
        What they'd like instead is a really great trip for their honeymoon. Gifts of cash or cheque are preferred to
        make this happen. We're very grateful to be able to go to a distant and exotic locale for an amazing trip.


        If you have any other questions or comments, please contact us. We look forward to seeing you there!
